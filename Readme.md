## Overview

This project is a unique portfolio website designed as a **command-line interface (CLI)** rather than a traditional graphical user interface (GUI).

- Type the `help` command to see all available commands.  
- Use different commands to learn about me — who I am, my qualifications, projects, contact info, and more.  
- To visit my standard GUI portfolio, type the `website` command.  
- Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
- Content is dynamically fetched using the Sanity.io API.
